# Raw_Data_Sandbox

The MTI team produced a sample of raw location data from mobile devices, called Raw Data Sandbox. The Raw Data Sandbox is prepared in order to allow various data users and the broader researcher and practitioner community to better understand raw mobile device location data and improve their confidence and appreciation of relevant data products (e.g., origin-destination tables and others). The Raw Data Sandbox is a sample of raw data, anonymized and aggregated to small zones to protect privacy. We must note that all raw data flaws, such as duplicate observations and location jumps, are intentionally left as-is in the Raw Data Sandbox, so that the potential users can also have a better understanding over data issues and limitations.

Users can use the raw data sandbox to see an aggregated sample of the data and develop and test algorithms for processing mobile device location data. Once algorithms are developed, users can refer to MTI's data lab (Link) to run the algorithms on the full disaggregate sample of the anonymized data. The data lab only allows user to get aggregate level query results from the full data sample.

The sandbox files are available on a public AWS S3 bucket:
