# Raw_Data_Sandbox
The MTI team produced a sample of raw location data from mobile devices, called Raw Data Sandbox. The Raw Data Sandbox is prepared in order to allow various data users and the broader researcher and practitioner community to better understand raw mobile device location data and improve their confidence and appreciation of relevant data products (e.g., origin-destination tables and others). The Raw Data Sandbox is a sample of raw data, anonymized and aggregated to small zones to protect privacy. We must note that all raw data flaws, such as duplicate observations and location jumps, are intentionally left as-is in the Raw Data Sandbox, so that the potential users can also have a better understanding over data issues and limitations.
